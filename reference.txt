Detailed Explanation of Every Folder & File (Senior-level, Fresher-friendly)

I’ll explain this exactly in the style you asked, similar to your examples.

📁 config/

Purpose: Central brain of the project

config.yaml

Used to store all configurable values such as:

Data paths

Model parameters

Feature flags

Forecast horizon

Inventory CSL

LLM settings

Why it exists:

Avoids hardcoding

Easy experimentation

Business + ML separation

This file controls WHAT the system does, not HOW.

📁 data/

Purpose: Stores all data given by or generated for the project

This folder represents customer and system data, not code.

📁 data/raw/

Stores original input data from business/customer

Examples:

CSV

Excel

❗ This data is never modified directly

Acts as a legal & audit reference

Example: Sales data from 2022–2024

📁 data/calendar/

Stores holiday, festival, and event data

Used to capture seasonality effects

Joined during feature engineering

📁 data/processed/

Stores cleaned and transformed datasets

Output of preprocessing & feature engineering

Used as input for modeling

Think of this as the “ready-for-ML” data layer

📁 outputs/

Purpose: Final deliverables for business & stakeholders

📁 outputs/forecasts/

Stores forecasted demand values (CSV)

Example: 2025 daily demand forecast

📁 outputs/plots/

Stores graphs and visualizations

Used in presentations and reports

📁 outputs/reports/

Stores evaluation summaries

Business insights

Observations & recommendations

📁 logs/

Purpose: Debugging, monitoring, audit

Contains execution logs

Critical for:

Production readiness

Pharma/enterprise compliance

Debugging failures

📁 src/

Purpose: All application logic (NO data here)

This is the heart of the system.

📁 src/ingestion01/

Purpose: Step 1 – Data ingestion & preprocessing

preprocessing.py

Reads raw data from data/raw/

Performs:

Null handling

Date parsing

Type correction

Basic validations

Saves cleaned output to data/processed/

❌ No feature engineering

❌ No modeling logic

📁 src/features02/

Purpose: Step 2 – Feature engineering

feature_engineering.py

Creates:

Lag features

Rolling means

Calendar joins

Demand classification (Low/Medium/High)

Fully driven by config.yaml

Outputs enhanced dataset to data/processed/

📁 src/models03/

Purpose: Step 3 – Model development

model_trainer.py

Contains training logic for:

Linear Regression

Random Forest

XGBoost

LightGBM

Prophet

Ensemble models

Uses parameters from config

❌ No hyperparameter tuning logic here

model_registry.py

Saves trained models

Loads models for inference

Handles versioning

📁 src/inventory04/

Purpose: Step 4 – Inventory decision logic

inventory_planning.py

Converts demand forecasts into:

Safety stock

Reorder point

Uses business rules like CSL

This is business intelligence, not ML

📁 src/llm05/

Purpose: Step 5 – LLM-based intelligence

llm_agent.py

Enables what-if analysis:

“What if demand increases by 20%?”

“What if lead time doubles?”

Uses LLM + regex fallback

Keeps system safe and explainable

📁 src/pipelines/

Purpose: Orchestration layer

run_pipeline.py

Runs end-to-end pipeline

Controls execution order

Used for automation and scheduling

📁 src/utils/

Purpose: Shared infrastructure code

config_loader.py

Loads and validates config.yaml

Fail-fast safety

logger.py

Centralized logging setup

Used by all modules

📁 tests/

Purpose: Quality assurance

Unit tests

Prevents regression

Professional standard

📄 main.py

Single entry point

Calls pipeline logic

Used for execution

📄 README.md

Complete project documentation

Explains architecture, flow, and usage

Mandatory for professional repos
